## Notes
Some of the notes are written on notebook papers and most of the notes are currently being transferred to Jupyter notebooks on my machine learning repo. The notes also include my own implementation and refactoring of the existing code from Stanford CS231n. In the near future, some of the code shall be re-written in Golang as an experiment on how well Go performs on numeric calculation. However, tensorflow model construction and training should still be done in Python.

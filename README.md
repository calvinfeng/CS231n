## How to run?
Go to the directory of each assignment, create a virtual environment with Python. 
```
virtualenv environment
```

Activate the environment
```
source environment/bin/activate
```

And then install project dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Tensorflow is probably missing, so install that too
```
pip install tensorflow
```

Then run jupyter notebook and look at each assignment's notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```
